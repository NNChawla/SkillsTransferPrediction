When designing predictive features for performance transfer between VR and real-world tasks, it helps to consider both the biomechanical and cognitive aspects of human motion and behavior. Beyond raw positional and rotational data, you can build more informative representations that capture how the user’s body interacts with the environment and how their movement patterns evolve over time.

Below are several categories and specific suggestions for features you might explore:

1. Kinematic Derivatives and Motion Quality Metrics

Velocities and Accelerations: You’ve mentioned velocities; you can also include accelerations, angular velocities, and angular accelerations of the head and hands.
Jerk and Higher Order Derivatives: Jerk (rate of change of acceleration) and even snap can reflect how smooth or abrupt movements are—an indicator of skill or comfort.
Path Efficiency Metrics: Calculate how directly the user’s motion moves toward a goal or target. For example, ratio of straight-line distance to the actual path length, or deviation from an optimal trajectory.
2. Temporal Dynamics and Coordination

Reaction Times and Movement Onset Latency: How long does it take the user to initiate a movement after a visual cue or task start signal?
Movement Duration and Task Completion Times: These can reflect efficiency and skill.
Intra-limb and Inter-limb Coordination: Examine correlations or consistency in timing between head rotation and hand motions. For example, how consistently do head turns precede or accompany hand reaching movements?
3. Spatial Relationships and Relative Positioning

Body-centric Coordinate Frames: As you mentioned, representing hand/head positions and orientations relative to the torso or pelvis can remove extraneous variance from global positioning. This often leads to more transferable features between VR and real-world contexts.
Relative Angles Between Joints or Segments: For example, the angle between the hand direction vector and the user’s forward-facing direction, or the relative azimuth/elevation angles of the head and hands.
Symmetry and Asymmetry Features: Measure differences between left and right hand movements. Symmetry might be important for certain tasks, and deviations could be a sign of difficulty.
4. Stability and Variability

Variance and Standard Deviation of Positions/Orientations: High variability in position or orientation might indicate lack of control or uncertainty.
Spatial and Temporal Smoothness Measures: Metrics like spectral arc length or smoothness indexes derived from movement trajectories can gauge how “fluent” a user’s movements are.
5. Task-Relevant Feature Engineering

Distance to Target and Accuracy Measures: Record how close the user’s hand/head comes to intended targets over time, or the endpoint error distributions.
Precision Metrics: If the VR task involves aiming or aligning with something, track the angular error or positional discrepancy at key timepoints.
Sequencing and Ordering of Movements: If the task involves multiple steps or sub-goals, capturing the order and timing patterns of these can be informative.
6. Cognitive Load Proxies

Movement Hesitation or Pauses: Periods of no motion or micro-adjustments might indicate uncertainty.
Time Spent Off-Target: How long does the user spend with their hand away from the "ideal" trajectory or endpoint?
7. Comparative or Expert-based Features

Deviation from Expert Trajectories: If you have data from expert or high-performing individuals, you can measure how closely a given user’s movement matches these “gold standard” patterns.
Learning Curve Features: Track changes in movement metrics over trials to see if performance improvement or stagnation in VR correlates with real-world outcomes.
8. Frequency-Domain Features

Fourier or Wavelet Transforms of Movement Patterns: Sometimes periodicities or characteristic frequencies in motion data can reveal underlying control patterns or fatigue.
9. Environmental and Interaction Context

Haptic/Interaction Data (If Available): Incorporation of feedback signals—like when the user touches virtual objects—and their timing and intensity.
Obstruction and Collision Metrics: Counting how often or how “hard” the user’s virtual limb intersects with virtual objects or boundaries may reveal spatial awareness and control skills that transfer to real-life performance.
