1. 1D CNN for regression, with fully connected layers for single output score
2. RNN (LSTM or GRU) for regression. Input is 6DoF position and orientation data, output is a single score from final hidden state or pooling layer.
3. Validate the model score by checking that the three-joint connector is incorportated correctly.
5. Better categorical variable encoding, potentially categorical embeddings?
7. Bagging, ensembling, stacking, voting, model souping, boosting, binning (segment sequence into bins, then use summary statistics of each bin with final score as new data point i.e. segment policy (needs to be renamed)), etc.
9. Apply PCA to identify which features contain most of the variance in the data, then use those features for the model.
10. Gestural clustering or embedding by segmenting data, then clustering or embedding the segments. Use the clusters as features for the model.
12. Potentially identify derived metrics, aggregate the scores for those metrics to output a single score.
13. Investigate gesture augmentation: "Effective 2D stroke-based gesture augmentation for RNNs", "Voight-Kampff machine for automatic custom gesture recognition threshold selection", "DeepNAG", "Machete Taranta".
14. Explore analagous tasks: User identification by movement, activity recognition from IMUs (phones, watches, etc.), Gesture recognition, Sports (golf, tennis, etc.) skill or performance prediction (accuracy, speed, etc.) from motion data, Wii/Kinect studies, Demographic prediction from motion data
14a. "Sports analytics machine learning", "player performance prediction using motion data", "rehabilitation outcome prediction using motion data", "Physical therapy machine learning", "human activity recogntion machine learning", "weable sensor data prediction"
15. Use optuna for hyperparameter tuning on the best performing models.

4. SVM with polynomial kernel and/or RBF kernel
6. LightGBM and RandomForest with SHAP feature importance
11. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for regression, with fully connected layers for single output score
(?) 8. Body Relative Transformation of features (use Schell et al.)
